# Data-Science-Journey
A structured journey through Data Science — from Python and EDA to Machine Learning and Deployment. Documenting my learnings, projects, and hands-on practice

# 🌟 My Data Science Learning Journey

Welcome to my Data Science learning log! 
This repository is a reflection of my ongoing journey to master Data Science, Machine Learning, and AI — one concept, project, and dataset at a time.

## 📌 Motivation

I'm a Data Science Master's graduate from the University at Buffalo, and this repo is my way of learning in public, reinforcing concepts through hands-on projects, and sharing knowledge with the community.
